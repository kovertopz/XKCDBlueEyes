XKCDBlueEyes
============

Implementation of https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html

Solution: https://xkcd.com/solution.html


This simulates the logic puzzle. We create an island with a guru and random
colors then add logicians to it. Each day is simulated by the logicians
thinking logically and attempting to leave on the ferry. All messages are
printed to the console. Lots of error checking to make sure everything works
correctly.
